# py-simple-calculator

A simple calculator written in python

I normally call this calculator the portable version of my c++ calculator

https://github.com/Jarmander333/cpp-simple-calculator

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.9.1
https://www.python.org/downloads/

* Notepad++ 7.9.1
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

## Folder Structure

The file *simplecalc.py* is both the execulatble script and the source file, so I puy it in a folder named *binsrc*. (no compilation necessary!!)

## How to use the program (a rough description)

When the program prompts you to enter a number you can enter (for example):

```
9
3.2
3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679...
```
**NOTE: The program does bug out when the answer consists of too many digits, and crashes, so don't do all of pi**

Then when the program prompts you to enter an operator you can enter one of the following 4 signs:

```
+
-
*
/
```

What it should look like:

```
Select operation.
Addition is +
Subtraction is -
Multiplication is *
Division is /

Enter choice(+, -, *, /): *
Enter first number: 1
Enter second number: 1
1.0 + 1.0 = 2.0
Press the Enter key to continue
```

ToDo List:

* Fix 0/0 bug
* Fix digits bug

Bugs List:

* When you do 0/0 the program crashes
* To many digits
